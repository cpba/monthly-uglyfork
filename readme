This was forked from https://github.com/kthornbloom/Monthly
It contains a number of hasty and ugly hacks to make it better fit the
project I was working on at the time. Because of the lack of code quality
and lack of general utility of the changes, I don't intend to merge
this back into upstream.

You can of course use this if you want but I wouldn't recommend it, use the original project instead.
